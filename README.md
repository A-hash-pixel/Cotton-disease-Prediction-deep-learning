# Cotton-disease-Prediction-deep-learning

Hey guys this is my first deep learning project done using Inception V3. This project aims in helping the farmers by predicting whether a cotton plant is diseased or not by using the images of the plants taken via drone. This project was done using google colab with Tesla K80 as GPU. The link for the data- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hIJJCHc_ENrDC4cGrAdOWn-VruZOSb5t?usp=sharing, also the model was able to achieve a accuracy of 95.2% and validation accuracy being 100%.
